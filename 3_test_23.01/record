Dec 5 experiments conclusion:
1. Time delay between publisher and subscriber, a little bit(1e-2) which can be ignored. 
2. Use message_filters to synchronize the subscribered topics information.
3. Show images published by realsense node publisher.
4. receiving the newest messages, queue size both set 1 in publisher and subscriber (actually the former be 1 is OK)

Dec 6 experiments conclusion:
1. Reader impinj needs activation for connecting to an extended hub.
2. To make sure no rfid information is left, queue_size is at least 15.

Dec 7, 8:
Bring together image using message filter and print out a picture together with an AOA.
Find papers, from Zihao to RFID to single object tracking.

Jan 19:
message_filter didn't work: rfid_msg has no attribute "header", including seq, stamp, frame_id
message_filter probably aligns the message according to header
try to add a header in rfid_msg

Jan 30:
fine tune P control in box-based tracking
: kp = -0.001 works well
check if header is in the same form, or newly added header is incomplete
: same form, seconds and nano-seconds, using 
Next plan:
1. run message filter and check if the messages align through time stamp
2. record data using P-controlled demo
3. transfer data to laptop 2


Feb 2:
Finish writing message filter with multiple sensor topics, pending testing.
Next plan:
1. test on 6 antenna arrays
2. transfer data to laptop 2
3. add depth alert into box based controller
4. more params in ros_navigation
